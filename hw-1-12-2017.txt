Absolute vs. Relative Paths

2. cd /
3. cd /home/amanda

5. cd ~
6. cd home
7. cd ~/data/..
8. cd
9. cd ..

Relative Path Resolution

1. No. There is a directory backup in /Users.
2. No. This is the content of Users/thing/backup, but with .. we asked for one level further up.
3. No. See the explanation for #2. We did not specify -F to display / at the end of the directory names.
4. Yes. ../backup refers to /Users/backup.
