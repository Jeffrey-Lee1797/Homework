Absolute vs. Relative Paths

1. cd .
2. cd /
3. cd /home/amanda
4. cd ../..
5. cd ~
6. cd home
7. cd ~/data/..
8. cd
9. cd ..

Relative Path Resolution

1. No because here is a directory backup in /Users.
2. No because this is the content of Users/thing/backup, but with .. requests one level further up.
3. No because we did not specify -F to display / at the end of the directory names. Also, see explanation for number 2.
4. Yes because ../backup refers to /Users/backup.

ls Reading Comprehension

1. No because pwd is not the name of a directory.
2. Yes because ls lists files and directories in the current directory when the directory argument is absent.
3. Yes because specifically uses the absolute path.
4. Yes.

Exploring More ls Arguments 

The -l arguments makes ls display additional information such as the file size in addition to the file/directory names. The -h argument displays “human readable” sizes (5.4k instead of 5467)
